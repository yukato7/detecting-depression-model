## Summary
### Title
Ordinal Logistic Regression with Partial Proportional Odds for Depression Prediction

## Questions

- ①What is the content?

Prediction depression with using "Ordinal Logistic Regression"

- ②What is the superior point comparing to previous research?

OLR Model is simple???

- ③What is the important method?

three model types: `COM`, `ACM` and `CRM` and three proportionality structures: `PO`, `NPO` and `PPO`
- ④How do they verify effectiveness?

`RMSE`, `Spearman correlaion`

- ⑤Is there any discussion about this paper?
This model is superior to existing CNN and GSR model.
OLR is simple model but useful for realistic data such as DAIC-WOZ.

- ⑥What paper should I read next?

doc/paper/Multimodal Measurement of Depression Using Deep Learning Models.pdf

Research `Ordinal Logistic Regression` and `GREP`
